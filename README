wxJAD

---------------------------------------------------------------------

wxJAD is a simple cross platform UI wrapper around the command
line JAD decompiler.  It was born out of frustration with the
DJ Java Decompiler.

wxJAD is not a Java editor, nor is it ever liekly to be.  It sole
purpose is as a class file viewer and code browser where the source
is unavailable.  I have found this invaluable when attempting to 
locate the source of issues in library code upon which my code
inevitably depends.

Dependencies:

Use CMake >= 2.6 to build.

See: http://www.cmake.org

wxJAD depends on wxWidgets.  I have used version 2.8.10
during development, but any 2.8 release should work.

Installation
============

If you have CMake and wxWidgets installed, it should be as easy as

Unix
----

$ cd wxJAD && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install


Windows
-------

Well, you're on your own to source a C++ compiler.  It has been built
using Visual Studio, as:

c:\wxJAD> mkdir build
c:\wxJAD> cd build
c:\wxJAD\build> cmake -G "Visual Studio 8 2005" (for example)
c:\wxJAD\build> 

Now there should be a wxJAD.sln file (or equivalent) you can open in Visual
Studio.

Note: This process has not been well tested.
